// Create a simple outline shape.
// Convert it to a class.
// In the constructor, set the shape's x and y coordinates as class properties (a variable that is specific to the class).
// Create a method (a class-specific function)  that renders the shape with the class properties (probably something like this.x andn this.yâ€”you may also want to use class properties with width and height). 
// Create a method that gives the shape some sort of movement.
// Use a for loop in the draw function to draw a number of instances of your class on the canvas.

// This video (while not me) does a good job of demonstrating the process. Parenthetically, this Youtube channel has some awesome p5 tutorials. https://youtu.be/T-HGdc8L-7w
