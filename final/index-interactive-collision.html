    <p>
        click a ball to make it grow. (Press "s" to save to your computer.)
    </p>
    <li>
        interactive-collision.js: 
        <ul>
            line 80 now seems to override that clicking a ball should increase the radius?
        </ul>
        <ul>
            when i click on the elements and they grow outside of the canvas, they get stuck moving parallel to that boundary.
        </ul>
        <ul>
            how can i incorporate some kind of user interaction that decreases the ball?
        </ul>
        <ul>
            how can i still have interaction/movement if the elements are touching at the start?
        </ul>
        <ul>
            how can i make the velocity a bit more... realistic? like if a pool ball hit another one, depending on the angle it'd move differently
        </ul>
    </li>
