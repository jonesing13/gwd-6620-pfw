/*  

- put a button on your list item that will allow users to duplicate instances of your collected items
- also introduce a delete button

See requirements below:

    Both the delete and duplicate functions should be passed as component props.
    Collections arrays should be converted to state variables.
    Delete and duplicate operations should update the collection array state variables
    Each collection item should have a button that trigger a method that removes the associated item from the collection array.

Your assignment will be graded upon:

    Required elements function as described
    JavaScript is well formed and follows correct syntax
    Demonstration of understanding of state and useState hook
    Demonstration of understanding of event handling and passing functions as props

Each grading criteria is worth 10 points

Note: Please don't forget to use good design. My demos are meant to show how to make things functionalâ€”I'm leaving the design up to you.
