// Description:
// You may opt to use this assignment as the springboard for week 3â€™s assignment. In this week, we will prepare the content for the quiz game.

// Create an array objects that represent a question and answer. The object should include a question property ("question" as the key and the actual question as the value) and an answer property ("answer" as the key with the actual answer as the value).
    const quizItems = [

        {
            question: "if time is an illusion, what is doubly so?",

            question: "what day could arthur never get the hang of?",
            answer: "thursday",

        {
            question: "fill in the blank: anyone who is capable of getting themselves made _______ should on no account be allowed to do the job",
            answer: "president",
        }

    // Do not check the answer yet. Just fire an alert combining "You answered " and then the response and then add " The correct answer was " and then display the answer property from the object. Use concatenation to string all these strings together.
    const quizFeedback = window.alert("you answered " + quizPrompt + " & the correct answer was " + quizItems[randomItemSelector].answer);

        // "cast"????
    // Using the plus sign as a concatenation operator, alert the user to your game. "You selected" + myGameArray[promptResponse -1 ].title + " which is a " + myGameArray[promptResponse - 1].type + " of game..." And so forth.
