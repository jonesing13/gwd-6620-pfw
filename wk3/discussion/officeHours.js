// toLowerCase() is a method that belongs to strings
const myString = "Hello There!";
console.log(myString.toLowerCase());

// definiing functions anonymously vs defined, currently just use the one that's more comfortable for you
// for loops, just use the one that's most comfortable for you. maybe some day you'll use fat arrow method cause it's less typing

// || logical or means if either left or right side of the statement

// = is for assignment. e.g. when assigning to a variable
// === used for strict equals (both the same value and the same data type)
// == approximately (doesn't necessarily have to be the same data type)

// +=, *=, -= are the equivalent of saying the thing is the thing +/*/- the info after the equals e.g. x += 5 is the same as x = x + 5

// ! negates whatever's on the other side of it
// myVariable = true, then !myVariable is false. it doesn't change the variable itself but it returns the opposite
// e.g. could be used for when you have a function that executes something, but you want to evaluate when that thing is not executed. then you could use !function
// truthy (e.g. is myString = 'bob' and you check if myString isn't empty, it's truthy but you probs will get 'truth' responses even if it's not SUPER accurate. and falsey isn't necessarily EXTREMELY accurate either. hence the -y

// when ken approaches a problem, i'll break things into chunks and have a function that represents each chunk.
// then ken makes the varaibles that need to support the executions of those functions
